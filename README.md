# Web-interface for interaction between your Bluetooth-compatible device and LEGO® SPIKE Prime Hub.

> A boilerplate for connecting LEGO® SPIKE Prime Hub to your website using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

This boilerplate shows how to connect/disconnect to a hub, start/stop a programm, send a message to hub, process it there, send a message from hub, process it on the website. It also shows how to set up an event listener structure. It is not 100% robust. There are some cases when it fails, but I couldn't replicate it.
